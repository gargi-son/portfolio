                                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;Adapted from the UC Berkeley curriculum, these Pacman projects are done as part of the Introduction to Artificial
                                        Intelligence coursework at George Mason University. These projects are briefly divided into 4 sub-projects, each of which deep dives into various concepts of 
                                        Artificial Intelligence:
                                        <br><br>

                                        <b><span class="primary">Project 1: Search( DFS, BFS, A*,  UCS): </span></b><br>
                                        &emsp;&emsp;Project 1 starts with basic exercises of search algorithms and uses the Pacman game as the reference to explore 
                                        different search algorithm concepts that are used in a plethora of real-world applications.<br> 			
                                        &emsp;&emsp;Here, the Pacman is programmed such that it successfully satisfies various use cases like finding the food dot in a maze 
                                        using DFS, BFS, and A* algorithms; finding all the corners by using heuristics functions, and many more. 
                                        These algorithms, implemented using python, are the basis of almost every navigation problem in the real world.  
                                        <br><br>

                                        <b><span class="primary">Project 2: Multiagent Search: Reflex agents, Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning, Expectimax, Evaluation function:</span> </b><br>
		                                &emsp;&emsp;Continuing with the Pacman maze game to explore the artificial intelligence concepts, this project focuses on 
                                        modeling Pacman both as an adversarial as well as a stochastic search problem. Using Python as the base programming language,
                                        we designed Pacman along with external agents including ghosts. This prepares the Pacman to take appropriate actions in 
                                        response to the randomness generated through these agents, making it more intelligent. The actions taken are based on the 
                                        evaluation function logic coded for the Pacman, to evaluate the state-action pairs.<br>
		                                &emsp;&emsp;The search mechanisms used here, minimax and expectimax, are a little more complex and use alpha-beta pruning to 
                                        explore the minimax tree. These form the basis of the game theory and building game-playing agents, capable of matching wits 
                                        with the strongest human minds to play games like chess and checkers.

                                        <b><span class="primary">Project 3: Reinforcement Learning: Value Iteration, Policies, Q-learning, Approximate Q-learning</span> </b><br>
		                                &emsp;&emsp;The goal of this project is to understand Model-based and Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms by 
                                        implementing the concepts of value iteration and q-learning.<br>
                                        &emsp;&emsp;Q-learning enables the agent to learn from trial and error from the interactions with the real environment 
                                        through its update method. We also introduce randomness to best match the real-world scenarios and allow the q-learning 
                                        agent to make decisions based on the current q-state values.<br>
		                                &emsp;&emsp;The above concept is then applied to a robot crawler, where the goal of the robot crawler is to move forward, 
                                        from point A to B. The crawler initially makes mistakes, unable to achieve its goal, but with every iteration, it learns 
                                        and forms the best policy to move forward.<br>
		                                &emsp;&emsp;The other implementation of reinforcement learning is in a game of PacMan, where it learns the values of 
                                        positions and actions by exploring every possible combination, failing, and starting again. Once the training is complete, 
                                        Pacman is put in the testing environment where it achieves its goal by the formulated policy.
                                        <br><br>

                                        <b><span class="primary">Exact and Approximate Inference, Joint Particle filter: </span> </b><br>
		                                &emsp;&emsp;This last project advances into developing sensors for Pacman to locate and eat invisible ghosts. The idea is 
                                        to make the Pacman intelligent, wherein it can predict not only where the ghost may be, but also the possible ways in which
                                        the ghost may move. To achieve this, we make use of exact and approximate inference methods to update the agentâ€™s belief 
                                        distribution to help us track the ghosts better.
